Since the pandemic, supply-chain shocks, rent spikes, and volatile energy prices have pushed inflation from a textbook concept into daily life—grocery runs, takeout, and monthly bills all feel louder now. It’s a hot topic on news feeds and in policy debates about “soft landings,” rate cuts, and the cost-of-living squeeze, and the attention only seems to be growing. For my **DSAN5600 Applied Time Series** project, I’m excited to unpack the data behind this story: track headline vs. core CPI, dive into key components like food, shelter, and energy, and study how interest rates and inflation expectations filter through. I plan to look for trends, seasonality, and possible regime shifts/structural breaks, then build interpretable forecasts and scenario paths for the next few quarters. It’s a way to turn everyday price pressure into a rigorous analysis—and, hopefully, into insight.\n\n**Here.** We study *time-evolving* U.S. living costs and how inflationary pressures pass through to households. We will analyze multiple cost categories—**food**, **shelter (rent/owner-equivalent rent)**, **utilities (electricity, piped gas, water/sewer/trash)**, **transportation (gasoline, transit, auto insurance/maintenance)**, and selected **household services** (e.g., childcare, healthcare out-of-pocket)—to understand **magnitude, timing (lags), heterogeneity, and regime shifts**.\n\n**Not here.** This page **does not** cover datasets, cleaning, or model specifics (they are in other tabs). Here we set the stage: *why it matters*, *what angles we'll take*, *what has been learned*, and *which questions will guide the work*.\n\n---\n\n# The Big Picture\n\nBelow is the conceptual map of the project. Each **angle** includes **more than 3 temporal data sources** we could analyze (links). This supports a modular site structure where each angle becomes a section with its own time-series models and findings.\n\n![Figure 1: Big Picture (Inflation → U.S. Cost of Living) — eight connected angles linking inflation to household budgets: Food Costs; Shelter; Utilities & Home Energy; Transportation & Fuel; Household Services; Supply Chains & Trade/Dollar; Expectations & Sentiment; Regional & Distributional; Policy & Regimes; Forecasts & Scenarios](bigpicture.jpg)\n\nThis analysis will consider the following seven main areas:\n\n1. **Household Budget Components (Food, Shelter, Utilities, Transportation).** The most direct way families experience inflation is through everyday purchases and monthly bills. Centering these categories connects macro price moves to lived reality and reveals where pressures concentrate (e.g., rent vs. groceries) and how categories may co-move or diverge over time.\n\n2. **Supply Chains & Trade/Dollar.** Many U.S. prices are downstream of global shipping conditions, import costs, and the U.S. dollar’s strength. Tracking these channels clarifies why domestic prices can rise even when local demand is soft—or ease when bottlenecks clear or the dollar strengthens—linking external shocks to U.S. inflation.\n\n3. **Policy & Regimes (Interest Rates · Regime Shifts).** Monetary policy sets financing conditions and anchors expectations. Highlighting rate cycles and potential **regime shifts** (e.g., from high, volatile inflation to a moderating phase) helps interpret structural breaks that a single average can hide, and frames the transmission from policy to household budgets.\n\n4. **Expectations & Sentiment.** What households and firms *expect* about future prices influences wage bargaining, contracts, and spending. Including surveys and market-implied measures (e.g., breakevens) illuminates feedback loops that can amplify or dampen realized inflation.\n\n5. **Regional & Distributional Patterns.** Inflation is not uniform. Housing scarcity, energy mix, commute modes, and local policy create different paths across regions and income groups. A regional lens prevents national aggregates from masking who bears the brunt of price changes—and when.\n\n6. **Household Services (Childcare, Health OOP, Internet/Phone).** Services are labor-intensive and often sticky, contributing to the persistence of **core** inflation. Elevating these items explains why inflation can stay elevated even after goods prices cool.\n\n7. **Forecasts & Scenarios (12–24 Months).** Rather than a single point forecast, scenario paths translate today’s drivers—policy, supply chains, expectations—into plausible futures, clarifying risks around the central outlook and the conditions that would accelerate or slow disinflation.\n\n\n# Literature Review\n\nThis review synthesizes evidence across our **Big Picture** angles—food, shelter, utilities & energy, transportation, expectations, supply chains & trade, and regional/distributional impacts—and explains how each theme informs our **time-series** choices (e.g., ARDL/local projections, asymmetric pass-through, regime/break tests, STL/X-11, and panel comparisons).\n\n## Food prices: pass-through, lags, and inputs\nRetail food inflation typically shows **incomplete and lagged pass-through** from upstream shocks; **energy** and **labor** costs often matter more than raw farm commodities at the shelf. USDA’s *Food Price Outlook* documents pandemic-era supply disruptions, disease shocks (e.g., HPAI for eggs), and category-specific timing, providing monthly CPI/PPI series and clear event windows that motivate distributed-lag modeling by category [@ers_fpo]. Recent Federal Reserve research quantifies U.S. farm-to-retail pass-through magnitudes and delays, offering priors for our ARDL/local-projection specifications and a benchmark for cross-category heterogeneity [@kc_farm2retail2024].\n\n## Shelter: stickiness and measured lags between market rents and CPI\nA central result is that **CPI shelter responds with multi-month lags** to movements in **market rents** due to lease terms, renewal smoothing, and rent-sample design. @ball2025 formalizes mechanisms that reconcile diverging paths of private rent indices and CPI shelter during 2022–2024. Practitioner analyses reach similar conclusions, stressing persistence risks and the role of market-rent leading indicators [@zillow2025; @roosevelt2025]. These findings motivate our empirical design in which private rent indexes **lead** CPI shelter; we estimate lag lengths and persistence and run pre/post-COVID stability checks.\n\n## Transportation fuels: asymmetric “rockets and feathers”\nThe oil-to-gasoline pass-through literature documents **asymmetry**—pump prices rise faster than they fall (“rockets and feathers”). U.S. studies report regional variation and nonlinearity, implying state-dependent responses we address with threshold/interaction terms or quantile-based local projections [@blair2017; @cook2019]. We apply asymmetric diagnostics to gasoline CPI, embedding crude or wholesale gasoline as drivers along with controls for taxes and seasonality.\n\n## Utilities and home energy: weather, seasonality, and energy channels\nHousehold **electricity** and **piped gas** costs are strongly seasonal and weather-sensitive; **heating/cooling degree days (HDD/CDD)** are standard predictors of load and bills [@eia_hddcdd; @epa_techdoc2021]. We incorporate HDD/CDD into seasonal decompositions (STL/X-11) and into monthly ARDLs for electricity and gas service CPI, testing interactions with fuel prices.\n\n## Supply chains, COVID-era regimes, and policy episodes\nPandemic-era inflation featured a **regime shift**: in 2021 global supply-chain shocks dominated, while by 2022 traditional demand/supply forces reasserted importance; monetary policy appears more effective after bottlenecks eased [@nber_digest2024; @bai2024]. We therefore run **structural-break tests**, estimate **regime-dependent** pass-through, and annotate policy windows (e.g., rapid tightening cycles) across categories.\n\n## Trade, import prices, and the dollar\nGlobal evidence shows the **U.S. dollar** plays a dominant role in pricing and transmission. A **1% dollar appreciation** predicts a sizable decline in global trade volumes within a year, with high pass-through into import prices; currency-of-invoicing frameworks further explain muted exchange-rate pass-through to U.S. consumer prices when imports are dollar-priced [@boz2017; @gopinath2016; @cavallo2021]. For our angles we treat dollar moves and import price inflation as external drivers for traded-goods categories (e.g., gasoline, durables), distinguishing border vs. retail pass-through.\n\n## Expectations and sentiment\nHousehold and firm **inflation expectations** influence near-term price dynamics and can amplify persistence. Recent surveys and syntheses highlight channels via which expectations respond to macro/news and, in turn, affect spending and pricing decisions; we include expectations as covariates in nowcasting and short-horizon prediction for selected CPI subcomponents [@coibion2022; @nyfed_sce].\n\n## Regional and distributional perspectives\n**Regional price parities (RPPs)** allow comparisons of price levels across U.S. states/metros, while **real personal income** series support regional purchasing-power narratives [@bea_rpp]. On the household side, the BLS **Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE)** provides expenditure shares and microdata for distribution-aware analysis, and recent summaries document **inflation differences by income** during 2021–2023 [@bls_cex; @bls_income_inflation]. These sources support **panel** and **distributional** modeling of burden by region and demographic group.\n\n---\n\n# Guiding Questions\n\n1. How quickly and by how much do headline/core inflation shocks pass through to food, shelter, utilities, transportation, and services?\n\n2. Which input costs (energy, wages, import prices) explain the largest share of category inflation, and how do their lags differ?\n\n3. Are food-at-home and food-away-from-home equally sensitive to inflation shocks?\n\n4. What is the lag between market rent indexes (Zillow/Apartment List) and CPI shelter?\n\n5. Do oil/gas shocks translate asymmetrically to gasoline/utilities (up faster than down)?\n\n6. How do seasonality and weather (HDD/CDD) shape utility bills over time?\n\n7. Where are regional disparities largest, and do they widen in high-inflation regimes?\n\n8. Did pass-through elasticities change before vs after COVID-19?\n\n9. What 12-month scenarios (energy high/low; core steady/declining) imply for household bills?\n\n10. Which categories most drive perceived inflation and budget burden for typical households?\n\n11. Do consumer inflation expectations help forecast category costs beyond standard drivers?\n\n12. Which categories show the strongest/weakest reversion after large shocks?\n\n13. How does import price inflation affect domestic retail prices across goods vs services?\n\n14. Are there structural breaks aligned with major policy episodes (e.g., rapid tightening 2022–2023)?\n\n15. Which category offers the best nowcast signal for next month's CPI?\n\n---\n\n# Why This Matters\n\nA coherent view of inflation → cost-of-living links improves:\n\n- **Policy evaluation** (are rate hikes disinflating shelter with a lag?)\n- **Household planning** (which bills will likely move next?)\n- **Business strategy** (pricing and cost management by category)\n- **Public understanding** (separating seasonal noise from genuine inflation pressure)","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n> *\"Eggs at $4?
