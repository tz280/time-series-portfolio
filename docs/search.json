    "text": "A time series is any sequence of measurements taken at regular, equally spaced intervals—seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, quarters, or years. Common examples include weather (daily temperature or rainfall), financial markets (daily stock prices or returns), industry indicators (monthly production or sales), electricity demand, traffic counts, and hospital admissions. In time-series analysis we study how these values evolve: their level, trend, seasonal or calendar patterns (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends, holiday effects), cycles, and anomalies. Typical goals are to describe behavior clearly, forecast future values, and quantify the impact of events or policies.\nBecause observations are ordered in time, nearby points tend to be correlated (autocorrelation). This violates the independent-and-identically-distributed assumption behind many standard statistical methods, so naïve cross-sectional tools often mislead. Time-series work must explicitly handle dependence, trend, and seasonality—for example by differencing, seasonal adjustment, and models that use lagged values and errors (e.g., ARIMA/SARIMA, ARIMAX/SARIMAX with external drivers, VAR for multiple series, state-space/ETS, or GARCH when volatility changes over time). Analysts also watch for structural breaks (e.g., policy shifts, COVID), outliers, and missing periods, and they evaluate models with time-aware validation (rolling or blocked splits) rather than random shuffles."

    "text": "“Eggs at $4? Gas over $5? Rent jumped—again.”\nOn a chilly morning in early 2023, a grocery receipt went viral: the total looked ordinary, but line items told a story—eggs doubled from a year earlier, milk and bread were up, and a short drive across town now cost noticeably more. That receipt captured what many households felt: inflation isn’t abstract—it shows up in carts, bills, and budgets.\nThis project asks a simple question with complex answers: How does inflation transmit into the everyday cost of living in the United States—across food, housing, utilities, transportation, and beyond—over time?"

    "text": "Food prices: pass-through, lags, and inputs\nRetail food inflation typically shows incomplete and lagged pass-through from upstream shocks; energy and labor costs often matter more than raw farm commodities for shelf prices. USDA’s Food Price Outlook documents pandemic-era supply disruptions, disease shocks (e.g., HPAI for eggs), and forecasting updates, providing granular monthly CPI/PPI series and narrative event windows that motivate distributed-lag modeling by category. Recent Federal Reserve research quantifies U.S. farm-to-retail pass-through magnitudes and delays, offering priors for our ARDL/local projection specifications and a benchmark for cross-category heterogeneity. We will combine CPI food subindexes with energy and wage covariates and evaluate pre/post-COVID stability. :contentReferenceoaicite:0"

    "text": "Shelter: stickiness and measured lags between market rents and CPI\nA central result is that CPI shelter responds with multi-month lags to movements in market rents due to lease terms, renewal smoothing, and BLS’s six-month change design. Ball (2025) formalizes mechanisms that reconcile diverging paths of private rent indices and CPI shelter during 2022–2024; this directly motivates our empirical design treating market rents as leading indicators and testing lag lengths/persistence. Policy briefs and practitioner notes further stress the persistence of shelter inflation relative to private measures, reinforcing our plan for before/after COVID and high-inflation-regime analyses. :contentReferenceoaicite:1"

Classic and subsequent papers on currency of invoicing explain low exchange-rate pass-through to U.S. consumer prices when imports are dollar-priced, while tariff pass-through at the border/store differs and can be high for targeted goods. For our angles, we treat dollar moves and import/retail price links as external drivers for traded goods categories (e.g., gasoline, durable goods) and stress differences between border and shelf pricing. :contentReferenceoaicite:5"
