    "text": "A time series is any sequence of measurements taken at regular, equally spaced intervals—seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, quarters, or years. Common examples include weather (daily temperature or rainfall), financial markets (daily stock prices or returns), industry indicators (monthly production or sales), electricity demand, traffic counts, and hospital admissions. In time-series analysis we study how these values evolve: their level, trend, seasonal or calendar patterns (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends, holiday effects), cycles, and anomalies. Typical goals are to describe behavior clearly, forecast future values, and quantify the impact of events or policies.\nBecause observations are ordered in time, nearby points tend to be correlated (autocorrelation). This violates the independent-and-identically-distributed assumption behind many standard statistical methods, so naïve cross-sectional tools often mislead. Time-series work must explicitly handle dependence, trend, and seasonality—for example by differencing, seasonal adjustment, and models that use lagged values and errors (e.g., ARIMA/SARIMA, ARIMAX/SARIMAX with external drivers, VAR for multiple series, state-space/ETS, or GARCH when volatility changes over time). Analysts also watch for structural breaks (e.g., policy shifts, COVID), outliers, and missing periods, and they evaluate models with time-aware validation (rolling or blocked splits) rather than random shuffles."

    "text": "“Eggs at $4? Gas over $5? Rent jumped—again.”\nOn a chilly morning in early 2023, a grocery receipt went viral: the total looked ordinary, but line items told a story—eggs doubled from a year earlier, milk and bread were up, and a short drive across town now cost noticeably more. That receipt captured what many households felt: inflation isn’t abstract—it shows up in carts, bills, and budgets.\nThis project asks a simple question with complex answers: How does inflation transmit into the everyday cost of living in the United States—across food, housing, utilities, transportation, and beyond—over time?"

    "text": "Food prices: pass-through, lags, and inputs\nRetail food inflation typically shows incomplete and lagged pass-through from upstream shocks; energy and labor costs often matter more than raw farm commodities at the shelf. USDA’s Food Price Outlook documents pandemic-era supply disruptions, disease shocks (e.g., HPAI for eggs), and category-specific timing, providing monthly CPI/PPI series and clear event windows that motivate distributed-lag modeling by category (USDA Economic Research Service 2025). Recent Federal Reserve research quantifies U.S. farm-to-retail pass-through magnitudes and delays, offering priors for our ARDL/local-projection specifications and a benchmark for cross-category heterogeneity (Scott, Lusomparodziewicz, and Cowley 2024)."

    "text": "Shelter: stickiness and measured lags between market rents and CPI\nA central result is that CPI shelter responds with multi-month lags to movements in market rents due to lease terms, renewal smoothing, and rent-sample design. Ball (2025) formalizes mechanisms that reconcile diverging paths of private rent indices and CPI shelter during 2022–2024. Practitioner analyses reach similar conclusions, stressing persistence risks and the role of market-rent leading indicators (Zillow Research 2025; Roosevelt Institute 2025). These findings motivate our empirical design in which private rent indexes lead CPI shelter; we estimate lag lengths and persistence and run pre/post-COVID stability checks."

U.S. studies report regional variation and nonlinearity, implying state-dependent responses we address with threshold/interaction terms or quantile-based local projections (Blair and Ruf 2017; Cook 2019). We apply asymmetric diagnostics to gasoline CPI, embedding crude or wholesale gasoline as drivers along with controls for taxes and seasonality."

    "text": "Trade, import prices, and the dollar\nGlobal evidence shows the U.S. dollar plays a dominant role in pricing and transmission. A 1% dollar appreciation predicts a sizable decline in global trade volumes within a year, with high pass-through into import prices; currency-of-invoicing frameworks further explain muted exchange-rate pass-through to U.S. consumer prices when imports are dollar-priced (Boz, Gopinath, and Plagborg-Møller 2017; Gopinath, Itskhoki, and Rigobon 2016; Cavallo et al. 2021). For our angles we treat dollar moves and import price inflation as external drivers for traded-goods categories (e.g., gasoline, durables), distinguishing border vs. retail pass-through."
